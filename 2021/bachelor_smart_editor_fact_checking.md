## Problem description
Fake news is huge problem. Part of the problem is bad journalism. The goal of this project is to change the fundamental way articles are written by journalists. The goal is to build a browser-based text editor which can automatically fact check the written text and highlight the false facts. You may assume there is an oracle which can fact check each sentence. The idea would be similar to the popular grammary solution which works as a plugin for browser and checks for grammatical errors wherever you type text.
