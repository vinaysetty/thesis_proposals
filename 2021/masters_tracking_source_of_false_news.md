# Background
  
Fake news has become a huge problem in our lives. One of the issues with fake news is that it is hard to track who started the rumor or conspiracy theory. 

# Problem description

Given a textual claim track the source of the claim. For example, "Scientists agree that climate change is a hoax" is a claim published by several blogs by citing a single scientific article by several conspriacy theorists. The goal of this project is to track these sources and visualize them. Past works have looked at tracking memes in different forms[1], the goal in this project is similar.
